\section*{Problem 2}
See programs in \textbf{02156-A5-s201186.pl}

\subsection*{Question 2.1}
The program \textbf{selectlist(?List)} will succesfully return a list of all nouns and verbs which have a sort order of 100 or less when queried with variable.
The program will succed if given the correct list.
\code{?- selectlist(List), length(List,L). \\
    List = [be, come, do, find, get, give, go, have, know|...],\\
    L = 20. \\
    ?- selectlist([be, come, do, find, get,\\
            give, go, have, know, look,\\
            make, people, say, see,\\
            take, think, time, use,\\
            way, year]
        ).\\
    true.
}

The program will fail when:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The list contains duplicates
    \item The list is missing a noun or verb that should be included
    \item The list includes a wrong noun or verb.
\end{itemize}
N.B. \textbf{...} indicates the first part of the correct list.
\code{?- selectlist([..., year, year]).\\
    false.\\
    ?- selectlist([...]).\\
    false.\\
    ?- selectlist([..., year, witness]).\\
    false.
}


\subsection*{Question 2.2}
The program \textbf{dump} succesfully finds all words that are both adjectives and adverbs and prints all additional categories with the word.
\code{?- dump.\\
above prep\\
back n\\
back v\\
close v
}
Given the data from database.pl, then the complete list yields 29 lines in total. See appendix for full output.
